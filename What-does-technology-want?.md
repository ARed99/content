[Music] [Music] hello i'm kevin kelly i'm senior maverick at wired magazine i want to talk about what technology wants and i have three points the first one begins with the world without technology this was a world where humans only lived to an average age of 35. it was a very very difficult life sometimes people talk about hunter-gatherers having banker hours where this is totally wrong it was a very severe and challenging environment it was helped by the fact that humans invented technologies from the very very beginning of our start hammers swords knives for the closet we did not have and one of the first things we humans did was to eliminate most of the megafauna animals throughout the world easy meat there were thousands of species and this changed the entire landscape of the planet once they were removed um the animals that we didn't kill off we tended to domesticate um wolves into dogs goats and pigs very very quickly 10 000 years ago and but really the very first animal that we domesticated was ourselves we changed ourselves we changed ourselves in many ways including taming fire to make it into a food technology so that we could cook cooking became an external stomach that we could process nutrition in a way that we could not otherwise and that nutrition changed our jaws changed our teeth changed our brains once we domesticated herding animals we could milk them and we very quickly evolved adult lactose tolerance within a few thousand years so we marched on with this new technology and changing ourselves and we settled the entire globe at the rate of about two kilometers a year on average and immediately very long before the industrial age we started to change the climate of the planet through the radication of megafauna through fire through other means so this became the most powerful force in the world first we changed ourselves then we changed the plants and animals around us we change the environment we change the entire planet and in that way humanity is our greatest invention and of course we're not done yet so almost from the beginning we had this very paradox which is that we are both creators and the created we are both the parent and the child at the same time we are the master and the servant we are the shaper and the shape at the same time and so the dilemma that we commonly have right now about whether we are being run by technology or running technology will forever be the paradox of our lives into a thousand years in the future we will still have the same dilemma the same paradox that we are both the creator and the created and this two-face aspect of technology is essential to our understanding because it's interwoven our humanity is something we invented and through our invention we have we have made other technologies and so this this is an integral part of ourselves we are a techno species and that's the number one point i want to make we are integral with technology we ourselves are technological the second point is that before darwin uh when naturalist biologists would go out to collect things in the world that they found living creatures plants animals living organisms they just made curiosity cabinets they made they made catalogs on them there was no theory about how they were connected together it was just one organism after another we are until recently been very similar in the technological realm because we have a parade of different technological inventions one after another but we haven't really had a very good theory or understanding of what connects them together how they're related to each other what they mean how they come about even the very concept of technology is very recent and we're still kind of grappling with what a good definition is one definition that i really like is that technology is anything that was invented after you were born because most of the stuff in our lives that surrounds us right now is technology that's been around for a long time but we don't think of it as technology it's concrete pavements it's lead or it's copper pipes it's switches it's wooden shelters these are all technologies even things like calendars and libraries even our law or technologies but we don't think of them in that way because they're old we think of technology as the new stuff danny hill says this technology is the stuff that doesn't work yet and that's kind of a good popular definition but in fact technology is a very recent idea itself even though it has been around for a long time we haven't really perceived it until very recently even the 1950s and before it was hardly ever raised in fact the term especially in english wasn't invented until 1829 centuries after it had been around and in use but it wasn't really even apparent to us i think technology is a cosmic force that has been around longer than even humans have it is a force that began at the big bang okay began at the big bang and at the big bang what's happened since then what's the universal rule of all physicists is that entropy has been increasing meaning that heat death has been increasing everything runs down and it's not to like a blackness it's too kind of a greatness because there's the point of high entropy means there's no difference everything is flat it's the same and that is the general drift of the universe except in a few little corners few little spaces here and air and fuse relative because there are actually billions of them but planets would form actually before planets particles would form and those particles will form molecules and these formations would gather through gravity into stars and stars are self-organizing the more there is the more they attract and so this self-organizational principle would eventually make planets and higher heavier elements all these things are like examples of self-organization and self-organization kind of runs like a counter to entropy in its local area we see increasing order over time and this entropy that decreases is what i call exotropy this increasing order accelerates the amount of entropy made in the local area and that's how it works so this extra trophy is self-organization and technology is an accelerated version of that exotropy it's an accelerated version of what goes through life it's accelerated version of what happens when the primarily universe organized into matter and molecules and stars and this thread this chain of matter forming and stars forming and then planets forming and spiraling galaxies forming and then life at least on this planet forming and life producing technology is this chain of self-organization that runs through the universe and so technology in that sense is an extension of that self-organizing force that began at the big bang and ran through life and one of the examples of this is the energy density which has been increasing all along through these different stages and it's the highest meaning the amount of energy that can flow through the smallest amount of matter in the smallest amount of time has been increasing and technology is the most energy dense in the entire universe your laptop is the most energy dense thing that we know of even more than a star so there is a great arc to technology running through the cosmos and it began the big bang ran through the origins of stars and galaxies and then planets and in life and then minds and will go beyond us that is the general story of technology we are just in the middle of that story and we could say to a first approximation that what technology wants is what evolution wants because it's the same force accelerated so the natural question would be well what does evolution want well evolution also has trajectories that's controversial i wouldn't really say it has destiny but it has directories it has directions and those directions are from simple to the complex it goes from sameness to diversity evolution moves from general things to specialization it moves from independence to mutualism it runs from dumbness to sentience and it runs from things that are very hard to evolve to things that are very easy to evolve so that's the general trends in evolution and those are the trends that we see in technology itself so just as there's huge diversity in the living world we see the same kind of explosion of diversity in the invented manufactured technological world we see the same kind of specialization that happens in life where you have a general purpose cell and then over time a body like ours might have 57 different kinds of specialized cells like heart cells or skeleton cells or muscle cells we see the same thing in technology where you might have a general hammer that does everything to specialize hammers to a camera that can do anything to a specialized camera like a high-speed camera or maybe an underwater camera or maybe a high-speed underwater camera and so that general movement is something we see in technology we see this huge diversity we can even follow kind of a lineage of how variations are made and passed on almost in the way of this genealogical chart of the shapes of armor medieval armor followed what looks like a taxonomical tree so i would i would go so far as to say there are six kingdoms of life roughly in today's understanding and that technology in a certain sense is the seventh kingdom that came out of the minds of humans okay it's it's the seventh kingdom of life and this seventh kingdom observes the same general trends that the other six kingdoms do this movement towards ubiquity and diversity towards specialization towards complexity it's the same thrust of this self-organizing force so this seventh kingdom of life that is technological is following the same things it wants the same things that life wants which is very very important because that suggests to us something important about the world that we're inhabiting technologically that is compatible with life now if you take a hand ancient homonoid stone flint hammer it's about roughly the same size and weight and shape as a mouse for your computer but i could probably make the stone hammer if i tried hard maybe practice for a couple of weeks but under no circumstances could i ever make a computer mouse it's beyond me because it requires hundreds of other technologies that i'm not a master of it is part of a system of technology i call that system the technium the tech game is not a particular single technology it's all technologies supporting each other together so to make a saw today you need a hammer and to make a hammer you need a saw and that spread further is the way that works so the mouse needs hammer saw factories electronics it meets thousands of other technologies and most of things we make today are co-dependent on the other technologies around them that system is called the technium and any system including the technium has its own agenda that's the nature of systems and just as plants want light want is a very loaded english word they move towards light they bend towards light they don't consciously want it in a conscious way but they gravitate to it technology also has its tendencies where it wants to go even though it's not conscious it has a bias has an urgency it's a tendency so it may just want power to to run itself i've seen a robot block myself or try to get around me as i was blocking it from its power cord so even though it's not conscious they can have a want and these are not specific destinations these are general tendencies imagine for the moment rain falling down a river valley and the thousands and millions of drink raindrops are falling down but the individual path of any one of those raindrops is completely stochadic it's random we cannot predict it but we can predict its direction which is downward for certainty we can't say specifically where it's going to go but it's going to go down that's the level of what we're talking about it's kind of like the water in the river valley as it meanders around we can't predict which part of the river is going through but we can say it's going to stay in the valley so these valleys these general directions are what we can talk about and so in the i would say that as soon as a civilization has electronic wires and silicon chips and radio waves it's going to make the internet it's going to make wi-fi it's inevitable okay and so these long-term trends can be predicted even though the specifics can't it's sort of at the level of uh we can say if you have a planet with the gravity like like the earth that you're going to have quadrupeds on it because that is a stable configuration physically but you won't be able to predict zebras which are much too specific okay so the form not the species so we could say that once you have telephones they're inevitable but the iphone's not the internet was inevitable but twitter was not so those are the general trends that we can talk about moving forward and i would say like right now that we're gonna ai is inevitable even though the specific character and who controls it and who owns it how it's run is not at all inevitable and they make those decisions those choices make a big difference to us so my definition of technology is anything useful produced by a mind it could be the mind of a beaver or a bird as they make nests and dams but it's also all the stuff that we make and it is a mind thing technology is like thinking it's a kind of thinking and if i right now was to talk and give you a bad idea you're not going to counsel me to stop thinking you just say that's a bad idea stop thinking but that's what we tend to do with technology when bad technology comes up people say i want less of it let's turn down the technology it's stopped the technology let's have less technology but a better a better response is if we have a technology say incandescent bulbs that run on tungsten that are very hot waste a lot of energy we say okay that's a bad idea let's have less light no that's like having less like thinking less let's have a better idea let's make a better light bulb let's make better technology okay so the proper response to a technology that is harmful technology that doesn't work yet technology that maybe is in some ways causes harm for the environment is not less of it but better of it an example would be ddt which was turned out to be sprayed as a pesticide for plantations and farms and it was horrible caused tremendous ecological devastation but the problem was it was doing the wrong job so ddt sprayed around in small doses sprayed around a household is the most effective malarial deterrent that we know of saving hundreds of millions of lives a year so it needed a better job it was we could make a better version of it so better ideas is what technology is and it follows in the same thrust of all the things that life wanted technology wants as well it wants to become more complex it wants to become more diverse it wants to become more specialized it wants to become more ubiquitous it wants to become smarter over time and it wants to evolve faster and faster technology wants clean water just like life does we need clean water to make these highly specific manufacturing processes it kind of wants the same thing that life wants and in fact we have never been able to make we or i should say we have always been able to make a greener version of whatever we make so we know that we can make greener and greener more more naturally compatible things because it is inherently like nature so so this is my second point which is that technology is the acceleration of nature it's not in opposition to it it's compatible with it because it comes from it and so it's many ways just the extension of nature and therefore it's always within our powers to help direct it become more greener because we've not yet found any technology that we could not make greener so the third point is that technology generally create almost as many problems as they solve new technologies create new problems the new technologies of artificial intelligence will create fantastical new problems that we've never had before and they will bring many new benefits the trick that we want is to try to create one percent more than we ever destroy in a year so so we it's not a very high bar it's we just need to be one percent better than our worst that means that maybe most of the stuff that we make may be garbage it may be trash we may have to throw it out but that's okay as long as we have one percent more better in a year than we have trash we can make civilization because that one percent difference between problems and solutions is all that we need to make civilization because one percent compounded hourly or by daily or by the year is what civilization is what civilization builds civilization that's almost the definition of civilization is the accumulation of one percent more that we create than we destroy every year and the problem with one percent is that it's almost invisible we can look around and we can hardly see one percent that's why the world can seem to be terrible in in great trouble if it's only one percent difference in the good and the bad but that oh one percent progress so to speak is really only visible in retrospect we have to look behind us to see we have to look into history we have to look into the past to see the fact that progress and that one percent difference is real but that is what technology gives us it brings us differences options possibilities choices freedoms diversity these are all the things these are why hundreds of millions of humans every year in recent decades have moved from their villages into the cities where it may not be the nicest place to live because what they get out of that are choices and possibilities they don't have at home at home they may be in a village that has organic food beautiful vistas they have a strong sense of family and community support they know who they are but they leave to go into the city where things are uncertain where it may be grimy and and gritty but they could be a mathematician they could be a ballerina which they could not be at home they'd have to be a farmer or farmer's wife so they're moving into the cities because cities are possibility factories because they have all the choices that technology head brings us and that is what technology gives us in the end even though it may produce more more problems they are new problems and each new problem is a possibility that did not exist before and a possibility to make good in a new way so this explosion of possibilities is what technology is moving towards is what it has brought us so far and it's what is going to deliver us in the future and i want to tell one story at the end and that is the story of possibilities imagine for the moment that mozart the great musical genius was born 2 000 years before he was born he would have been maybe a farmer or maybe he was a hunted gatherer there were no musical instruments like a piano or a symphony for his genius to take root and flower so the world would have missed his genius his musical genius none of that stuff would have ever any of his composures composures and symphonies would have ever been composed and of course mozart himself would have missed that same genius as well and that opportunity for his art and um we could also imagine the painter van gogh who maybe he was born 5 000 years before oil paints were invented in canvas and brushes and what a loss to the world that would have been to miss his genius and of course the genius that he would have missed himself the pleasure of painting and we can extend that to you know a filmmaker like alfred hitchcock and if he had been born thousands of years before we had invented the technology of cinema and all that would have been missing because of his genius so what that means is that every generation we're inventing new technologies and there are more people born who have a chance to express their genius because the technology is ready for them so that means that someone like my son who was 10 or 12 at this picture is waiting for us collectively to invent a technology the possibility for his genius to be expressed because maybe it's a holographic display maybe it's something else that we haven't yet have that we're about to make that will allow that genius to be expressed so somewhere in the world today there may be a shakespeare of their time and she's waiting for us collectively as humans to invent the tools to share for her genius to shine so we in a certain sense have a moral obligation to keep inventing new technologies and new possibilities with the hope that every person born on the planet and yet unborn may have a chance to use their special mix of talents in a way that would require this technology and we can supply that to them and they can therefore express it and share it and that's why even though when we're working on technology that may seem something that we may throw away it may seem disposable it may seem like it's something that's not important it may seem there's only commerce or it's in some ways just part of capitalism that's okay because it's actually even because it's bigger than that because when we are making inventing new things we are participating in that long arc that i'm talking about this online that goes through from the beginning of the big bang and goes through the cosmos and through life and us that long arc of increasing the possibilities in the universe that's the long arc that we're participating in when we make an event something new is we are part of this process of expanding the possibilities the choices the opportunities in the universe and especially for other people and by the way we're also expanding for ourselves as a species we may become more things than we are right now and we will so that's the possibility space that we're spending and that's what technology is about it's about this long arc through the cosmos of expanding the possibilities making them more and more and more possible and that is the great thing that technology gives us increases possibilities so um the three things about technology one is that we are techno species we're completely integrated we are technological in many senses we have long left the period where we're dependent on technology we are wholly dependent on technology and forever more the second thing is that technology is a natural process it's an acceleration of the natural self-organizing force in the universe it is compatible with nature with our choice we can make it so and the third thing is that this is a movement through the universe of increasing the possibilities for all beings for all things and when we participate in making new technologies we are expanding that possibility space for all and that's the good stuff about technology and that is what technology wants so thank you for your attention
