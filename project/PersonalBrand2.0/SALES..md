## 6 Magic Keys That Control Buyers

### Magic Control Key 1: Buyers can be sold, if you can reward them.

Buyers can be persuaded to buy if they feel that they or their company will be rewarded. 

If I can give my buyers a win by solving their problem or serving them better, then they will be happy to give me the win of an improved income.

**Example** :
  You can get a child to eat lima beans if you promise her ice cream afterward! Your young son strikes a deal with his mother that he’ll go to bed if she lets him watch an additional half hour of television.

  1. Understand that selling is a numbers game. If you’re prospecting for new business as hard as you should be, there will always be a high percentage of people who will turn you down. There’s no reason to feel rejection personally because they don’t all buy.

  2.  Move away from what your product will do for the customer, and emphasize what you will do for the customer. Joe Girard, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s top car salesperson, says, “They don’t buy Chevrolets. They buy me.” The more you can convince customers how hard you’re going to work for them, the less they can make the case that they’re rewarding you by giving you the order.

  3.  Convince the buyer that what he is buying is scarce and he is lucky to get it. (There is more about this in Chapter 5: How Scarcity Motivates Buyers.)

  4.  Convince the buyer that you don’t do business with everyone who asks to buy from you. Tell buyers that to become a customer of yours, they must meet your requirements. That may sound like a stretch, but it can be done. Do you think that you could call up Boeing Aircraft and order a jet from them? I doubt it, even if you were paying cash. They would want to know why you want the plane, who’s going to fly it, and what it’s going to be used for (especially after September 11th).

  5.  Convince your customers that they have to qualify to reach certain levels with you and your company. Explain that your company has silver, gold, and platinum customers. The higher their level, the more privileges they get from you. Then, they have to work to reach the higher level or convince you to make an exception and treat them as though they were at the higher level.
